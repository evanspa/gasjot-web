# gasjot-web

gasjot-web is a web application for collecting gas purchase and other data about
your vehicle.  It's a fun application to use to track your gas purchase and
utilization history.

It is implemented as an isomorphic Javascript application using React and
Redux.  The
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is used
to communicate with [Gas Jot's REST API](https://github.com/evanspa/pe-gasjot-app).

## About the Gas Jot System

The Gas Jot system is a client/server one.  This repo, *gasjot-web*, represents a client-side application of
the Gas Jot system.  There is also an iOS client application:
[GasJot-ios](https://github.com/evanspa/GasJot-ios).

*FYI, the Gas Jot iOS application is much more featureful than the web app.  The
iOS app offers more charts, offline mode, data export, location-based
conveniences, etc.*

The server-side application of Gas Jot provides a REST API endpoint (*written in
Clojure*) for the client applications to consume:
[pe-gasjot-app](https://github.com/evanspa/pe-gasjot-app).
